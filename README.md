## Project Name: Care or Don't Care
Website Access: Our Website is deployed here via Framer: https://careordont.framer.website/

Purpose: For INFO 442, we have developed a quarter long project called "Care or Don't Care: With the premise of UW students being able to sift through and save topics that they are interested.  

Process: In order to make our idea come to life, we first began to draw our dream using Figma, where we could create all the wireframes and fidelity sketches we wanted. Then to bring our efforts to fruition, we imported these sketches to framer, which automatically converted our sketches to a static website. In order for us to breath movement into our creation on Framer, we then used tools on the website to create responsivity, dynamicity, and content.

Our Figma sketches can be found here: https://www.figma.com/file/9sQHauix99H8gAuvBpCpyY/Splendid-File?type=design&node-id=4%3A15&mode=design&t=8j9eaOoLygMPliyH-1
